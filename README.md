# Student-Form
This Student Registration Form is a stylish and interactive web project built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input and submit student information like name, age, gender, course, and email — which then dynamically appears in a responsive table. The interface features animated background gradients, smooth transitions, and a clean glassmorphism design for a modern look. A delete option lets users remove individual entries, and a toast notification confirms successful submissions. Perfect for frontend practice or portfolio demos, the project is fully responsive and designed to impress.
